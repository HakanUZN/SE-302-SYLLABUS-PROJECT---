 SE-302-SYLLABUS-PROJECT---
TEAM 10

# GOAL

The program aims to let users add their course outlines, view them alongside older versions, make edits, delete syllabuses, and easily export/import for better accessibility and organization.

# ABOUT APPLICATION

The program was made using JavaFX, a tool that helps build user interfaces. We used UI Scene Builder to create the design. We also took advantage of some helpful tools in Java, like JSON and JavaFX libraries. After finishing the project, we turned it into a JAR file. This means it can run on any computer that has the right version of Java.

The page in the image is the main page of the project. There are 5 buttons on our main user interface. These buttons are New Syllabus, Search Syllabus, Import, Help, and Exit. You need to perform the operation here by selecting it with the help of these buttons.

On the form page, users have the flexibility to input the required information based on users preferences. Once user have completed filling out the form, user can choose to save it for future reference or storage.

On the search page, users can find and view a previously saved form. While viewing the form, they cannot make changes directly. However, by clicking the edit button, they can make modifications and save it. This new form is then saved as a separate version, while the previous version of the form is retained.
